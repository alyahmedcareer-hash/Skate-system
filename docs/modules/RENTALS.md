# Module: Rentals

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED — PENDING FINAL VERIFICATION  
**Last updated:** 2026-09-21 (Phase 05 Final Remediation — all VG2 findings resolved, documentation reconciled)

---

## Purpose

The Rentals module is the core operational module of KOSHK SKATE ERP. It manages the full rental lifecycle from skate selection through payment, active monitoring, return, and late fee handling.

---

## Current Implementation Status (Phase 05)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend — Rental POS | IMPLEMENTED | Multi-step flow: Skate → Duration → Customer → Review → Start |
| Frontend — Active Rentals view | IMPLEMENTED | Operational status (normal/ending_soon/overdue) computed server-side |
| Frontend — Return workflow | PLANNED | Phase 07 |
| Backend — Rental service | IMPLEMENTED | `startRental()`, `getActiveRentals()`, `getRentalConfig()`, `calculatePrice()` |
| Backend — Late fee calculation | PLANNED | Phase 07 |
| Database — rentals table | IMPLEMENTED | Migration `0004_rentals.sql` applied — all indexes present |
| Database — settings table | IMPLEMENTED | `rental_hourly_rate` + `rental_duration_options` seeded |
| Database — rental_payments table | PLANNED | Phase 06 |
| Database — late_fee_records table | PLANNED | Phase 07 |
| API routes | IMPLEMENTED | POST /rentals, GET /rentals, GET /rentals/active, GET /rentals/:id, GET /rentals/calculate-price, GET /rentals/config, GET /customers/:id/rentals |
| Tests | IMPLEMENTED | 62 Phase 05 tests (31 TC-RENT-* integration + 5 RBAC + 5 VAL + 5 CFG + 16 unit). 168 total system tests pass. |

## Phase 05 — Implemented APIs

| Method | Path | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v1/rentals` | `rentals.create` | Start rental |
| GET | `/api/v1/rentals` | `rentals.view` | List rentals (paginated, filterable) |
| GET | `/api/v1/rentals/active` | `rentals.view` | Active rentals with operational status |
| GET | `/api/v1/rentals/:id` | `rentals.view` | Rental detail |
| GET | `/api/v1/rentals/calculate-price` | `rentals.create` | Preview price (server-authoritative, no rental created) |
| GET | `/api/v1/rentals/config` | `rentals.create` | Rental POS configuration (rate + standard durations) |
| GET | `/api/v1/customers/:id/rentals` | `customers.view` | Customer rental history (paginated) |

**Phase 07 endpoints — NOT implemented in Phase 05:**
- `POST /api/v1/rentals/:id/return`
- `POST /api/v1/rentals/:id/waive-late-fee`

---

## Rental Code Strategy (DEC-062, DEC-070)

Rental Codes use format `RN-NNNNN`. The numeric portion is derived from the auto-increment `insertId` of the inserted Rental row.

- INSERT with temporary placeholder → read `insertId` → derive `'RN-' + String(insertId).padStart(5, '0')` → UPDATE in same transaction
- Gaps in numbering caused by rolled-back transactions are explicitly **allowed** (DEC-070)
- Codes are **never reused**
- UNIQUE constraint enforced at DB level

---

## Operational Status (DEC-066)

Server-computed display states (never persisted):

| State | Condition |
|---|---|
| `normal` | remaining time > 5 minutes |
| `ending_soon` | remaining time ≤ 5 minutes AND current time has NOT passed expected end (including exact equality) |
| `overdue` | current time **strictly greater than** expected end (`NOW() > expected_end_at`) |

At exact equality (`NOW() === expected_end_at`): **NOT overdue** — classified as `ending_soon` with `remainingMinutes = 0`.

---

## Duration Configuration (DEC-069, F-06, DEC-070)

Standard duration options are read from the `settings` table (`rental_duration_options` key).

- Backend throws `RENTAL_DURATION_CONFIG_INVALID` if the key is missing, malformed, empty, or contains non-positive-integer values
- No hardcoded fallback list exists in application code
- Frontend displays an error state with a Retry button if configuration cannot be loaded
- Custom duration input remains available per DEC-069 (must be > 0, no maximum)

---

## Business Rules (Phase 05)

1. Skate must be `available` to start a rental
2. Only one active rental per skate at any time (FOR UPDATE lock inside transaction)
3. Rental price = `Math.round(hourlyRate × durationMinutes / 60)` — whole EGP
4. `price_per_hour` and `rental_amount` are immutable snapshots at creation
5. `expected_end_at = started_at + durationMinutes`
6. Deactivated customers cannot start a rental (422 CUSTOMER_INACTIVE)
7. No payment recording in Phase 05 (Phase 06)

---

| TD-RENT-02 | Payment recording missing — deferred to Phase 06 | Phase 06 |
| TD-RENT-03 | `settings` table has no admin UI — values require direct DB access | Future Settings phase |

## Business Responsibility

- Skate rental lifecycle: start → active → return
- Late fee calculation and collection/waiver
- Rental status monitoring
- Payment collection (single or split)
- Integration with inspection workflow on return

---

## Business Rules

1. Skate must be `available` to start a rental
2. Only one active rental per skate at any time (concurrent prevention required)
3. Rental price comes from configuration (stored at time of rental, not referenced later)
4. Expected end time = `started_at` + `duration_minutes`
5. Late time starts only after `expected_end_at`
6. Late fee = `late_minutes × configured_rate_per_minute`
7. System distinguishes: calculated fee, collected fee, waived fee
8. Late fee waiver requires the `waivers.approve` permission
9. Every waiver must be recorded in audit log with user, amount, timestamp, reason
10. Skate becomes `rented` on rental start; back to inspection on return
11. Historical rental amounts are immutable after creation

---

## Frontend

**Location (target):** `apps/web/src/modules/rentals/`

**Key screens:**
- Skate selection grid (cashier home)
- Rental POS form (duration, price, customer, payment)
- Rental summary / confirmation
- Active rentals table
- Return flow (return time, late fee, payment)

---

## Backend

**Location (target):** `apps/api/src/modules/rentals/`

**Key services:**
- `RentalService.startRental()` — atomic: validate skate + create rental + record payment + update treasury + update skate status
- `RentalService.returnRental()` — record return time + calculate late fee + trigger inspection
- `RentalService.waiveLateFee()` — check permission + record waiver + create audit entry
- `RentalService.getActiveRentals()` — return rentals with computed remaining time

---

## Database

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rentals` | Core rental record |
| `rental_payments` | Payment components (supports split) |
| `late_fee_records` | Calculated, collected, waived amounts |

**See:** `docs/architecture/DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full schema.
